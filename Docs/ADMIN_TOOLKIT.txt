# HSpace Admin Server Toolkit #
###############################

1. What is the Admin Server Toolkit?

The Admin Server Toolkit is a collection of services that come
with the HSpace package to allow developers to create applications,
separate from HSpace, that can communicate with and administrate
HSpace without the administrator ever having to login to the
game.  Simply imagine sitting down at your computer, launching
a graphical program, and telling it to do everything you would
normally have to login and use text commands to do.  While the
Admin Server Toolkit does not provide this application, it provides
the necessary code to enable developers to create these applications.
By providing the basic layer of communication, each developer can
develop his/her own applications with his/her own style.

The Admin Server Toolkit consists of two primary pieces.  These are
the HSNetwork library and the HSpace Server.  As a developer you
need only concern yourself with the first of these two things.  The
HSpace server is fully integrated with HSpace and is maintained by
the HSpace developers.

2. How can I use the toolkit?

The HSpace package includes several components: HSpace itself, the
HSNetwork library, and the AdminTest example.  By compiling HSpace
with your game, and turning on the ADMIN_SERVER options in hspace.cnf,
you have already told HSpace you want to allow remote applications
to connect to the server.  Your next action item should be to look
over the AdminTest program to get an idea of how to use the HSNetwork
communication layer.  Finally, you will want to develop your own
application architecture that makes use of the HSNetwork in your
own approach.  Do not think for a moment that the AdminTest program
is the only way to develop an application.  It is nothing more than
a simple application that shows how to communicate with the HSpace
server.

3. Do I have to use the Admin Server with HSpace?

No.  By default, the admin server is turned off in your
hspace.cnf file.  You can turn it on if you want people
to be able to remotely connect to your HSpace server,
but it's not an obligation.

4. What languages can I use with the Admin Server Toolkit?

The toolkit was built with C++ developers in mind.  We realize
that many people enjoy Visual Basic and Delphi, and it may be
possible to use the HSNetwork library with these languages.  In
the future, we hope that someone will develop a generic wrapper
to create an ActiveX (COM) object that can be used by any language.
Since the Admin Server Toolkit is very young, it is currently only
distributed as a C++ communications library.
