HSpace 4.4.1p1 Millenium Edition
http://www.mindgames-studio.com/trac/hspace


1. What is HSpace?

If you are familiar with MUSH, then you probably have some idea of what
HSpace is.  If you're not familiar with MUSH and online text games (that's
what a MUSH is), then you probably have no use for this package.

HSpace (Hemlock Space, from the Hemlock series of games) is a sort of "plug-in"
to online text games, adding to the game a virtual space environment with ships
that can navigate and engage in combat and a variety of other space-like things.
Since most text-based game engines (e.g. PennMUSH or TinyMUSH) only provide a
basis for creating an online text game, to create a space game you either need
to develop your own space engine, choose not to have any space flight at all, or
download and install a package like HSpace.  You have obviously chosen the 
latter of the three.  If you are still interested in using HSpace, then 
continue reading the sections to follow.

2. SUPPORTED GAME ENGINES

HSpace 4.4.1 is currently only compatible with PennMUSH 1.8.3p7
Later versions of PennMUSH will not compile and as we are starting
a new development line of HSpace there is no desire to work on backwards
compatability at this point as the fixes would need to be made in Penn.

While HSpace has been used with TinuMUSH and MUX at this time those engines
require extensive modification.  Check with the developers for these packages
as they may have released pre-modified/compiled versions of their codebases
with HSpace.

3. PACKAGE CONTENTS

You have unpacked the HSpace package, which contains a single "hspace" directory
with the HSpace source code and this text file that you are reading.  There is
a Makefile in the same directory, which you will use to build the HSpace 
library.

4. BUILDING HSPACE

First, you will need to unpack and compile your game engine, be it PennMUSH or
whatever.  It is important for you to compile your game without HSpace to be 
certain that you can even get that far.  Build your game, start it up, and get
it running well.  If you install HSpace without first testing your game without
it, you won't be able to distinguish normal game problems from problems that
could be caused by the space system!

Ok, you know your game works, right?  Shut down your game, and let's build 
HSpace.

To build HSpace, you need to do the following things:

For PennMUSH:

1. Move your hspace directory into your pennmush/src directory, 
   so that your hspace directory should be at pennmush/src/hspace.

2. Go to the hspace directory, and type make.

If all goes well, it should compile.  You should see several lines like 
"Generating dependencies for ..." and "Compiling ..."  If you see any errors, 
you have compilation problems that were not forseen when this package was 
created.  If that happens, go to the sectioned titled "WHERE TO GET HELP" in 
this guide.

When your package is done building, you will see a file called in the hspace 
directory named "libhspace.a." This is the fully compiled HSpace code that 
will need to be "plugged in" to your game engine.

5. INSTALLATION HSPACE FOR PENNMUSH

You will need to modify one two files for PennMUSH to add HSpace: src/local.c 
and Makefile.in.

** It is a good idea at this point to make a backup of each file you modify
so you may easily revert to a working version of PennMUSH if needed.

Make the following change to Makefile.in (in the pennmush directory):

** This line may include other defines, just make sure you add the stuff at the 
** end starting with -lpthread.
Change: CLIBS=@LIBS@
To: CLIBS=@LIBS@ -lpthread -Lhspace -lhspace -Lhspace/hsnetwork -lhsnetwork -lstdc++

Note that this assumes you have your hspace package directory in the 
pennmush/src directory! If this is not the case, then you should have  
-L<path to libhspace.a> (e.g. -L../spacestuff/hspace).

Make the following changes to src/local.c, but do not include the <--- and the 
text after it!:

local_startup(void)  // <--- Find this
{
	hsInit(); // <--- Add this
}

local_dump_database(void) // <--- Find this
{
	hsDumpDatabases(); // <--- Add this
}

local_shutdown(void) // <--- Find this
{
	hsShutdown(); // <--- Add this
}

local_timer(void) // <--- Find this
{
	hsCycle(); // <--- Add this
}

local_data_free(dbref object __attribute__ ((__unused__))) // <--- Find this
{
    hsDestroyObject(object); // <--- Add This
}

In pennush/src/destroy.c, change:

Around line 83 change: 
static void free_object(dbref thing);

to:
void free_object(dbref thing);


Around line 589 change:

static void
free_object(dbref thing)

to:

void
free_object(dbref thing)


When you have made these changes, change to your top-level PennMUSH directory, 
and type './configure', which will regenerate your main Makefile, 
then type 'make' then 'make install', which should compile PennMUSH again and link the 
HSpace code with your game.

In the PennMUSH game directory, make a directory named "space," and copy the 
hspace/hspace.cnf file to this directory.  Edit the hspace.cnf, and change 
things as you please.  

Copy all files in the hspace/help_files directory to your 
pennmush/game/txt/hlp directory.  From pennmush/game/txt type 'make' to 
rebuild the help files.

Restart your game, and you should have HSpace commands available.  Type 
'help hspace' for the HSpace help files.

6. WHERE TO GET HELP

** It should be noted that HSpace has become somewhat defunct with little to 0
support to be found. 

HSpace has been in use for quite some time and has had time to evolve, but the 
package is free, so to some extent you must expect there could be some problems
that take time to sort out.  One of the main problems could be that the package
doesn't compile for you.  This would not be a surprise, and the developers 
will need to know why it failed.  Another problem could be that these 
instructions were not clear enough, so the developers will need to know that as
well.  Or maybe you just have some burning questions on your mind and want to 
ask them.  In any case, here's the address where you can contact the 
developers of this package, and this package only!

gepht@hspace.org, mark@moosh.net

Please include the package version, found in hsversion.h, the operating system
you are using for your game server, and a decent description of the problem or
question.
